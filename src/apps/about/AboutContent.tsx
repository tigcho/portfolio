						Hi, my name is Selin! I'm passionate about exploring the inner workings of technology,
						discovering media from cultures different from my own, and sometimes simply immersing myself in a good video game.
						I tend to think deeply about things, and I prefer taking my time to understand them thoroughly.
						I value honesty, authenticity, and freedom in all aspects of life, and I strive to live by these principles every day.
